The tools under RotationCurve category will eventually deliver a whole bunch of
FITS files which are all 1-d spectra extracted from the 2d long slit spectra.
These will have to be fed to Starlight. But Starlight has its own way of
accepting information about the spectra. So, there will first be a need for
creating suitable input files. Once Starlight runs, there will have to be
suitable files which can parse Starlight output and give suitable information
about the same.

This folder contains various utilities to achieve the same.
