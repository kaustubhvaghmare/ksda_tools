This folder contains various programs to deal with 2d FITS spectra, especially
from SALT and help achieve the following.
- Determine the rotation curve for a given absorption or emission line.
- Fit a spline function to the rotation curve.
- Choose apertures, perform derotation and create added spectra.

Once a whole series of spectra are generated, the user can then run the tools in
the Starlight folder which parse the output generated by these programs into a
Starlight compatible form.
