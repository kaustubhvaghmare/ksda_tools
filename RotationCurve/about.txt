This folder contains various programs to deal with 2d FITS spectra, especially
from SALT and help achieve the following.
- Determine the rotation curve for a given absorption or emission line.
- Fit a spline function to the rotation curve.
- Choose apertures, perform derotation and create added spectra.

Once a whole series of spectra are generated, the user can then run the tools in
the Starlight folder which parse the output generated by these programs into a
Starlight compatible form. 

The following is the outline of the programs available here
GetCurve.py - program to interactive fit rotation curves on 2d spectra
GetCurve2.py - modification of the above program to accept a centroid through command
line as opposed to being automatically determined. Needed when dealing with irregular
objects.

RotationCurveLib.py - support functions for the above code.

MakeMeanCurve.py - this program displays the rotation curves one by one and then 
allows you to choose which curves may be combined in order to make a final mean
rotation curve for the galaxy.

MatplotlibCustom.py - just to add some enhancements to the default plots

FitRotationCurve.py - Fits a spline rotation curve to the galaxy.
FitRotationCurve2.py - Fits a polynomial of user defined order to the galaxy.

DerotExtract.py - program that uses fitted curve to perform derotation and addition.
Relies on IRAF's sarith task to do the work right. Unlikely to be working well.
May be thrown away eventually.

DerotExtract2.py - a mod of the above program which actually uses PySynphot's
spectral resampling algorithm to do derotation and addition.

ApertureLibrary.py - contains utilities needed by DerotExtract.py or DerotExtract2.py
for them to work properly.
